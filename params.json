It also uses CppUnit for its testing suite, which is compiled optionally.\r\n\r\n# Features / Roadmap\r\n\r\n1. [x] A utility for creating strings with embedded ANSI attributes\r\n  * [x] terminalpp::string\r\n  * This will be immediately useful in line-oriented programs to construct and output streams of attributed (coloured, emboldened, underlined, etc.) text.\r\n\r\n2. [x] A utility for managing ANSI escape codes that are not bound to specific characters.  For example, commands for moving the cursor, changing the screen's title, clearing the screen, etc.\r\n  * [x] terminalpp::terminal\r\n\r\n3. [x] Utilities for managing screens of attributed characters\r\n  * [x] terminalpp::canvas\r\n  * [x] terminalpp::canvas_view\r\n  * [x] terminalpp::screen\r\n  * This will be useful for those who wish to develop a more graphical or \"curses-style\" user interface.\r\n\r\nYOU ARE HERE! What follows is for future implementation.\r\n\r\n4. [ ] A set of classes that implement a windowing user interface\r\n  * [ ] terminalpp::component\r\n  * [ ] terminalpp::layout\r\n  * This will enable developer to create fully featured console-based UIs that can be delivered over any channel to which you can write text, such as terminal windows or even TCP/IP socket connections.\r\n  \r\n5. [ ] A database of terminal types and their associated behaviours\r\n  * With some kind of application-specific terminal type detection, this would make it possible to write apps that automatically adjust to the most appropriate protocols supported by the client.\r\n\r\n# Status\r\n\r\nTerminal++ is currently automatically tested using:\r\n\r\n* Clang 3.4: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KazDragon/terminalpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KazDragon/terminalpp)\r\n\r\n# The Basics\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the library is to be able to allow the usage of ANSI escape codes to their fullest potential in order to create fully-featured text-based applications.  The use cases for such software include interactive forms of command-line software, and even GUI-style applications over the internet using terminal emulators such as Xterm, PuTTY, or even some MUD clients (e.g Tintin++).\r\n\r\nAt its most fundamental level, Terminal++ is in the business of manipulating character elements on the screen, where each element is encoded as a glyph, which describes the character that is presented to the user, and a series of non-character graphical attributes. These are encapsulated in the following classes:\r\n\r\n* terminalpp::glyph - represents a character (which may be ASCII or any UTF-8 value up to U+FFFF) and its character set (by default, this is the US_ASCII character set).\r\n* terminalpp::attribute - a collection of variables that describe the non-character graphical part of the output, such as the foreground and background colours, whether it is bold, underlined, and so on.\r\n\r\nThese are combined into Terminal++'s fundamental type, terminalpp::element.\r\n\r\n# Strings\r\n\r\nterminalpp::elements can be collected together using the terminalpp::string class.  It has several constructors for different uses.  For example, one of the constructors takes a std::string and an attribute to apply to all those characters for when you want something like print out a single red error message.  In addition, there are the user-defined literal suffixes _ts (terminal string) and _ets (encoded terminal string) to help construct more complicated strings\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    using namespace terminalpp::literals;\r\n    terminalpp::string text = \"Hello, world!\\n\"_ts; \r\n    std::cout << text;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Constructs a terminalpp::string, and then prints it as simply, \"Hello, world!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using _ets, you can also encode attributes within the text.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    using namespace terminalpp::literals;\r\n    std::cout << \"\\\\[1Hello, \\\\[2World! \\\\x\\\\U263A\\n\"_ets;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints out \"Hello, \" in red text, then \"World!\" in green text, and then a smiley face in the default colour.  See the Wiki for more information about the attribute encoding used and its possibilities.  It is also possible to change the attributes for each element programatically.\r\n\r\n```\r\nterminalpp::string text = ...;\r\ntext[0].attribute_.intensity_ = terminalpp::ansi::graphics::intensity::bold;\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Terminals\r\n\r\nAt this point, you have everything you need for a standard command-line application that uses colour or other properties, such as you might see in the output of a Cmake script or Google Test results, or even standard unix functions such as ls.  But for greater control over the terminal, Terminal++ supplies the terminalpp::terminal class.  This allows the user complete control over the terminal's appearance.\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    using namespace terminalpp\r\n    terminalpp::terminal terminal;\r\n\r\n    std::cout << terminal.save_cursor();\r\n              << terminal.move_cursor({0,23})\r\n              << terminal.write(\"\\\\U263A\"_ets)\r\n              << terminal.restore_cursor()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis writes a smiley face in the (0, 24) position on the terminal -- usually the bottom-left corner. The cursor position is unchanged. The terminal uses a 0-based co-ordinate system where point (0, 0) is the top-left corner, and the co-ordinates are in (x, y) order.\r\n\r\nNote that it is necessary to output the results of the terminal operations.  This is because terminalpp is datastream-agnostic: it doesn't know where the terminal you're writing to actually is.  It could be standard out, it could be some named pipe, or it could be a network socket.  This gives you the flexibility to use Terminal++ in any situation where there is some kind of terminal emulator on the other side of a stream, without imposing any kind of restrictions. \r\n\r\n# Canvas and Screen\r\n\r\nFor even finer control of the terminal, the terminalpp::canvas class presents a grid of elements upon which you can \"paint\" the desired appearance of the terminal on a frame-by-frame by simply assigning to the appropriate co-ordinates:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    terminalpp::canvas canvas({80, 24});\r\n    \r\n    // Set the entire canvas to be the letter 'x' on a shocking pink\r\n    // background.  Because, why not?\r\n    for (terminalpp::s32 y = 0; y < canvas.size().height; ++y)\r\n    {\r\n        for (terminalpp::s32 x = 0; x < canvas.size().width; ++x)\r\n        {\r\n            terminalpp::element element('x');\r\n            element.attribute_.background_colour_ =\r\n                terminalpp::high_colour(5, 1, 2);\r\n                \r\n            canvas[x][y] = element;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, assigning elements to the canvas wont actually cause any immediate effect.  For that, you would need to index over the entire canvas and output it, element-by-element, to a terminal.  But it's very wasteful to output the entire screen each time that a small part of it changes.\r\n\r\nTo control this, we present the terminalpp::screen class, which represents a double-buffered approach to drawing the contents of a canvas.  Its draw() member function will cause only the differences between the previously drawn canvas and the current canvas to be output, with efforts made to keep the output as small as possible.  Note: it is assumed for the first canvas drawn, and for any canvas drawn after a change in output size, that everything has changed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    terminalpp::terminal terminal;\r\n    terminalpp::screen screen;\r\n    terminalpp::canvas canvas({80, 24});\r\n    \r\n    // ... Shocking pink screen as before ...\r\n    std::cout << screen.draw(terminal, canvas);\r\n    // screen is now actually shocking pink.\r\n    \r\n    canvas[10][15].glyph_ = 'y';\r\n    canvas[10][15].attribute_.background_colour_ = \r\n        terminalpp::ansi::graphics::colour::blue;\r\n        \r\n    std::cout << screen.draw(terminal, canvas);\r\n    // screen is still shocking pink, but there is now a letter 'y' with a\r\n    // blue background at position (10, 15).\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# News\r\nThis project began as an effort to factor out the terminal handling of the Paradice9 project (https://github.com/KazDragon/paradice9).  Just recently, Terminal++ has been ported back to Paradice9 with great success, as a demonstration that the library is ready for general use.\r\n",
